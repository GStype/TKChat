### About TKChat


This manual was made to help you properly use TKChat, along with useful
information about the way it functions. TKChat is a simple, secure Peer-to-
Peer chat application, which allows users to communicate with each other.
The application utilizes encryption and decryption during message
exchanging. All messages sent get encrypted, and decrypted when the other
peer(s) successfully receive them, as long as all peers have the same
decryption key.

The default Encryption key is 100. The key can be
changed to any integer number. However, all users must have the same
encryption number before launching the application, otherwise the encryption-
decryption process will not work correctly.


### How to Connect and communicate with peers

Now that the application is running, the user will be asked to insert a port, a
username and the other user’s IP Address and port. The port should be the one
that the users have already forwarded. It is recommended
that all users have the same forwarded port. All users have
the same port (7585).


Once a user is connected successfully, all users including themself will be
notified. The users can disconnect from the chat by typing “&leaveChat”. All
users will be notified when a user disconnects.
